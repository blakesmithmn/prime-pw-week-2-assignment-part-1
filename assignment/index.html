  <ul>
    <li>My scripts at one point stopped logging after line 80-something in the stretch goals ... I'm not sure what
      happened? Also ...
      even though it appears my logic worked on question 16 it seems that the variable logs as undefined? why is that!?
    </li>
    <li>Honestly the later two stretch goals didn't make a ton of sense to me but I gave them a shot ... </li>
    <li>I learned the hard way to not accidentally have two copies of the same file open or auto save might get funky
      and you might lose whatever progress you made!
    <li>I think I wrapped my head around the basics of ternary ~ but I would need more examples to be sure!</li>
